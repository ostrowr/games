# Games

A few games for which I've coded up a solution; usually just to experiment with a new programming language or idea.

## Sudoku
An attempt at a fast [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) solver. This implementation can solve the ``hardest'' sudokus -- those with the minimal 17 clues -- in about 4 milliseconds on average on my 2016 MacBook Pro, and often solves them much faster.

## Spelltower
Solving [Spelltower](http://spelltower.com/), which is a silly iPhone game that's basically Boggle with gravity. There are a bunch of game types, but the only deterministic one is tower mode.

## Ghost
Solves n-player [Ghost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_(game)).

## Connect 4
Attempt to solve [Connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four#Mathematical_solution) â€“ unfinished; can only a fraction of possible games at the moment. Will possibly implement a knowledge-based approach in the future.
